ðŸ“Œ **Personal Practice Repository â€“ Algorithmic Problem Solving & Coding Interview Prep**

## â–Œ Description

This repository contains my **personal solutions** to algorithm and data structure problems, mostly written in **Python** and **C/C++**.  
The goal is to **strengthen problem-solving skills**, prepare for **coding interviews**, and reinforce **computer science fundamentals**.

Problems are inspired by platforms like **LeetCode**, **CS50**, and other online judges.

## â–Œ Repository Status ðŸ“ˆ

### â–  **Organized by platform and topic**  
â–¸ LeetCode solutions (Python)  
â–¸ CS50-inspired problems (C / Python)  
â–¸ Custom logic exercises for learning and experimentation  

### â–  **Actively maintained**  
â–¸ New problems added regularly  
â–¸ Solutions are being reviewed and optimized
